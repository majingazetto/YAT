# YAT
**YAT** Yet Another Terminal. MSX TCP/IP UNAPI Terminal with YMODEM. 


YAT is another telnet program for MSX. There are a lot of great terminal/telnet/
communication programs in MSX. RS232 like COMS6, ERIX or BaDCaT Wifi
Modem and TCP/IP UNAPI like [Ducasp Telnet](https://github.com/ducasp/MSX-Development/tree/master/UNAPI/TELNET) or Konamiman's simplified terminal
[TCPCON](https://github.com/Konamiman/MSX/blob/master/SRC/NETWORK/tcpcon.asm).

Why a new one? Because there is no terminal for [TCP/IP UNAPI](https://github.com/Konamiman/MSX-UNAPI-specification/blob/master/docs/TCP-IP%20UNAPI%20specification.md) supporting **YMODEM** upload protocol. In other words: You *can't upload files* to Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) or other machines using Ymodem (XModem Checksum / CRC) protocol.

Why do you need a terminal/telnet with full YModem support? Why not? :)

My main goal is returning to my BBS/Fidonet activities. I mean, I would like to
read / write / create echomail and netmail as I used to do 20 years ago. It
sounds very sad but today with the new and great communication cartridge/boards (GR8NET, DENYUNET, OBSONET, ...) we can't upload QWK mail to any BBS.

**YAT** is a real raw terminal. This means it's not a fast / colorful terminal.
And YAT does not support ANSI. No menus, no online-help. The aim is
upload/download files to/from BBS systems.

So if you want to enjoy ANSI Art you are in the wrong place. Neither if you want
to use YAT as online-terminal to interact, read or write messages.

## Regarding licence:

You can copy, share and use all files. Separately or the project. There is no licence here. You can earn money with my code. There is no problem because even if I tell you not to do it, you will do it.
